If you heard this from someone you may think they\u2019re talking about a rollercoaster, or the last few minutes of the World Cup Final &#8211; but here, we\u2019re talking about Sam and Sounds&#8217; newest release, \u2018Addicted To You\u2019. After gaining a listener-base from his debut single, that far exceeded anyone\u2019s expectations, he has followed up with what is arguably a stronger track for his 2nd release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sam speaks on the track below &#8211; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;This song was written on a 45 minute train journey home from London, when I was feeling particularly grateful. I had been suffering for several years with shocking mental health conditions and had seemingly been pushed to the breaking point multiple times. One particular Sunday, about 5\/6 months before I wrote this song, I was at church and during the worship part of the service, I heard what I believe to be God\u2019s voice saying the words &#8211; \u2018that\u2019s it, you\u2019re coming out of it\u2019 &#8211; over and over again in my head. Literally, from that point, I no longer suffered from the unexplained anxiety and depression that had virtually ruled my life for the best part of 2 years. The lyrics are a direct message to Jesus, celebrating who he is and what he did for me!\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The song is out on the 15th of May and you&#8217;ll be able to listen to it on major streaming platforms!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8216;It\u2019s a fun, energetic, and suspenseful 3 minutes of your time that you won\u2019t regret spending\u2019.
